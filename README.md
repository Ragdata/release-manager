## ‚≠ê Project Overview

> `Release Manager` does exactly what it says on the label, it manages your releases for you but the way it does so is just a little bit special - this software can be used both on the command line or as part of a GitHub Workflow! 

`Release Manager` is comprised of 5 main parts:

**1. Versioner** - the first thing that `Release Manager` needs to do is determine what the next version should be.  You always have the option of telling RM which version to use, but it also has the means to work this out for itself.
<br /><br />
**2. Git Log Parser** - then it automatically grabs every commit record from the git database between the last tagged version and the latest commit which has contains one of the [commit types][commit-types] you have configured to be included in your changelog
<br /><br />
**3. Changelog Builder** - `Release Manager` uses a simple template to group and format those commit messages into an organised and coherent changelog which makes the entire history of your project visible and meaningful
<br /><br />
**4. Version Bumper** - the software then sorts through your git branches and bumps the version number of the files you indicate in the config file and saves those updated files to the appropriate branch waiting for the next step
<br /><br />
**5. Tag Creator** - and finally, `Release Manager` creates a tag of your staging branch with all changes made and committed to the appropriate branches, ready for you to either make manual adjustments to any other files you wanted to include with this **release version** - then all you have to do is deploy your new release!

What happens from here depends on whether you're using the **Command Line Version** of `Release Manager`, or the **GitHub Actions Version**.

## üìÇ Global Installation

> This project follows the [Gitflow Workflow][gitflow], so the [`develop branch`][develop] is likely to be in an unstable or even broken state between releases.  Please use the latest [release version][release], or code from the [`master branch`][master] if you want more stable code.



> <p align="center">You can either install Release Manager as a global package on your server,<br>or you can spin up the Docker version  (coming soon) and manage your releases on any system</p>

### Step 1 - Clone the Repo

Clone the Release Manager Repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ragdata/release-manager
```

> **NOTE:**
> * If you want to work with the latest, but most unstable code, clone with `--branch develop`
> * If you want to work with the most stable latest release, clone with `--branch master`

### Step 2 - Setup the Environment

Enter the directory you cloned the repo to and execute the following command:

```shell
sudo config setup
```

When this step finishes, you'll need to restart your terminal session, and the software will automatically pick up from where it left off and continue:

### Step 3 - Install the Software

Kick off the automatic installer with this simple command:

```shell
sudo config install
```

## üëç Supporting the Project

> If you've found this or any of my other projects useful in some way and you're motivated to help out, one of the easiest ways to do that is to make sure you give this project a ‚≠ê - 

The creation and maintenance of Open Source Software is definitely a labour of love - this is never going to be a path to riches.  The truth is, it takes not only a lot of time, it creates a substantial amount of personal expense, even when you're working on a shoestring, to keep these projects online and freely available.   



If you've found this or any of my projects useful in some way and would like to help out, even the smallest of contributions would go a long way towards helping me to keep them freely available to the community.
