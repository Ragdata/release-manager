## ‚≠ê Project Overview



## üìñ Table of Contents


## üß© Requirements

This project requires the following packages to run smoothly:

- Git
- MoreUtils
- JQ
- JO

You can install them in a single command like so:

```shell
sudo apt install -y git moreutils jq jo
```

## üìÇ Installation

> This project follows the [Gitflow Workflow][gitflow], so the [`develop branch`][develop] is likely to be in an unstable or even broken state between releases.  Please use the latest [release version][release], or code from the [`master branch`][master] if you want more stable code.



### Step 1 - Clone the Repo

Clone the Release Manager Repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ragdata/release-manager
```

> **NOTE:**
> * If you want to work with the latest, but most unstable code, clone with `--branch develop`
> * If you want to work with the most stable latest release, clone with `--branch master`
